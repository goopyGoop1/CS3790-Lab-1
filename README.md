# CS3790-Lab-1

I used NetBeans to make this project.
The main is located in the CS3790SimpletronV2 class 
The classes needed are  CS3790SimpletronV2 , CPU and Operation_Instruction. 
The CS3790SimpletronV2 handles the memory the loading of the file. It will take a file or user inputs to load the file. 
The CPU has all the registers. THe majority of the code is in here. exeSML() is the main function that uses a switch case to handle the execution(Operation_Instruction) of the file or user inputs. 
The Operation_Instruction are just the OP_CODES used by the switch case.
