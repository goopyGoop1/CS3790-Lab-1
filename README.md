# CS3790-Lab-1

I used NetBeans IDE 22 to make this project.

The main is located in the CS3790SimpletronV2 class 

The classes needed are  CS3790SimpletronV2 , CPU and Operation_Instruction. 

The CS3790SimpletronV2 class handles the memory & the loading of the file. It will take a file or user inputs to load the file into memory  

The CPU has all the registers. The majority of the code is in here. exeSML() is the main function that uses a switch case to handle the execution(Operation_Instruction) of the file or user inputs. 


The Operation_Instruction are just the OP_CODES used by the switch case. 

I've started my array at memory[50] = 55 this we don't have to print a bunch of pages 

Use the sml2.sml file to run the arraysum that you gave us. 

The minMax.sml should be taking in an array and giv you the min and the max. I was unable to finish this. It takes the array but it's giving me the same value for both min and max. I know it's my logic (it will run just not the right outputs)

I did not do the GCD. I've run out of time. 

I will add that if I woud have completed CS2290 before taking this class it would have helped with my understanding of this project.
